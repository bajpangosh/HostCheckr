# WordPress Automated Check Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ 1. Network Header Issue
**Error:** `plugin_header_invalid_network: The "Network" header in the plugin file is not valid`

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed `Network: false` from plugin header
- WordPress only accepts `Network: true` or no Network header at all

**Files Modified:**
- `hostcheckr.php` - Removed Network header line

### ✅ 2. Discouraged Function Issue  
**Error:** `load_plugin_textdomain() has been discouraged since WordPress version 4.6`

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed `load_plugin_textdomain()` function call
- WordPress.org automatically loads translations for hosted plugins
- Removed `load_textdomain()` method from class
- Removed action hook for `plugins_loaded`

**Files Modified:**
- `hostcheckr.php` - Removed load_textdomain method and hook

### ✅ 3. Outdated "Tested up to" Version
**Error:** `Tested up to: 6.4 < 6.8. The "Tested up to" value is not set to current WordPress version`

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated "Tested up to" from 6.4 to 6.8 in both files
- Ensures plugin appears in WordPress.org searches

**Files Modified:**
- `hostcheckr.php` - Updated plugin header
- `readme.txt` - Updated repository header

# Result: No syntax errors detected
